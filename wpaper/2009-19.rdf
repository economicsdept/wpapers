Title: On the Robustness of Brain Gain Estimates
Abstract: Recent theoretical studies suggest that migration prospects can raise the
expected return to human capital and thus foster education investment at home
or, in other words, induce a brain gain. In a recent paper (Beine, Docquier
and Rapoport, Economic Journal, 2008) we used the Docquier and Marfouk
(2006) data set on emigration rates by education level to examine the impact
of brain drain migration on gross (pre-migration) human capital formation in
developing countries. We found a positive e¤ect of skilled migration prospects
on human capital growth in a cross-section of 127 developing countries, with
an elasticity of about 5 percent. In this paper we assess the robustness of our
results to the use of alternative brain drain measures, denitions of human
capital, and functional forms. We nd that the results hold using the Beine et
al. (2007) alternative brain drain measures controlling for whether migrants
acquired their skills in the home or in the host country. We also regress other
indicators of human capital investment on skilled migration rates and nd a
positive e¤ect on youth literacy while the e¤ect on school enrolment depends
on the exact specication chosen.
