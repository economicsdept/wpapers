Title: Measuring the Extent of Inside Trading in Horse Betting Markets
Abstract: This paper develops a theoretical model that examines the optimal price
setting by on-course bookmakers in the racetrack betting market. The model suggests
that opening prices should include a premium that compensates bookmakers for
the risk that insiders will account for private information and exploit any
mis-pricing made by the bookmakers. The model is an extension of the
model developed by Makropoulou and Markellos (2007) for football betting to
the racetrack betting market. Using an extensive dataset and performing Monte Carlo
simulations to calculate the potential value of new information, we measure insider
trading in the Australian racetrack betting market.
