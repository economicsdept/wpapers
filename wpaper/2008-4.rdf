Title: Static Stability in Games
Abstract: Static stability of equilibrium in strategic games differs from dynamic stability in not being
linked to any particular dynamical system. In other words, it does not make any assumptions
about off-equilibrium behavior. Examples of static notions of stability include evolutionarily
stable strategy (ESS) and continuously stable strategy (CSS), both of which are meaningful or
justifiable only for particular classes of games, namely, symmetric multilinear games or
symmetric games with a unidimensional strategy space, respectively. This paper presents a
general notion of local static stability, of which the above two are essentially special cases. It
is applicable to virtually all n-person strategic games, both symmetric and asymmetric, with
non-discrete strategy spaces.
