Title: The Tax-Foundation Theory of Fiat Money
Abstract: A government can promote the use of an object as the general medium of exchange by accepting it in
tax payments. I prove this old claim in a dynamic model and compare the mechanism to convertibility.
The government can often keep its favourite money in circulation even while increasing its quantity and
thus causing it to decrease in value. This opens the door for an inflationary policy. Most successful fiat
moneys have been acceptable for tax payments, typically due to legal tender laws. Numerous historical
failures of fiat moneys are consistent with the theory.
