Title:Small Price Changes, Sales Volume, and Menu Cost
Abstract:The finding of small price changes in many retail price datasets is often viewed as a puzzle.
We show that a possible explanation for the presence of small price changes is related to 
sales volume, an observation that has been overlooked in the existing literature. Analyzing 
a large retail scanner price dataset that contains information on both prices and sales 
volume, we find that small price changes are more frequent when products’ sales volume
is high. This finding holds across product categories, within product categories, and for 
individual products. It is also robust to various sensitivity analyses such as measurement 
errors, the definition of “small” price changes, the inclusion of measures of price 
synchronization, the size of producers, the time horizon used to compute the average sales 
volume, the revenues, the competition, shoppers’ characteristics, etc
