Title:Price Gouging or Market Forces? Fairness Perceptions of Price Hikes in the Pandemic
Abstract:We report the results of surveys we conducted in the US and Israel in 2020, a time
 when many prices increased following the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
To assess respondents’ perceptions of price increases, we focus on goods whose prices have increased 
during the pandemic, including some essential goods. Consistent with the principle of dual entitlement,we 
find that respondents perceive price increases as more acceptable if they are due to cost shocks than if they are due to 
demand shocks. However, we also find large differences across the two populations, as well as across goods.
