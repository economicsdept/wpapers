Title: Endogenous Growth Theory and Models: the “First Wave”, 1952–1973
Abstract: In previous papers (Spear and Young 2014, 2015a, 2015b), we surveyed the
origins, evolution and dissemination of optimal growth, two sector and turnpike, and
stochastic growth models. In this paper, we focus on endogenous growth theory and
models. However, in contrast to our previous findings regarding optimal growth
theory and its offshoots, which exhibited fairly direct lines of conceptual
development, the endogenous growth story, as will be seen, is multifaceted, with a
more complex pattern of intellectual evolution.
