Title: Financial Sector Regulation and the Revolving Door in US Commercial Banks
Abstract: The “revolving door” is a practice quite widely in use in the United States, in which
heads of state agencies, after completing their bureaucratic terms, are entering the very
sector they have regulated.This phenomenon is also frequent in France, where it is
coined “pantouflage”, and in Japan, coined “amakudari” (descent from heaven).
Research conducted and data collected by the research group Corporate Europe
Observatory strongly suggest that this process is also significant within EU institutions.
