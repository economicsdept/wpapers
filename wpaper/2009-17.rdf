Title: Framing-Based Choice: A Model of Decision-Making Under Risk
Abstract: In this study we propose an axiomatic theory of decision-making under risk that is based
on a new approach to the modeling of framing that focuses on the subjective statistical
dependence between prizes of compared lotteries. Unlike existing models that allow
objective statistical dependence, as in Regret Theory, in our model the emphasis is on
alternative subjective statistical dependence patterns that are induced by alternative
descriptions of the lotteries, i.e., by alternative framing. A distinct advantage of the
proposed general descriptive model of choice is its ability to adequately explain a wide
variety of behaviors and, in particular, several well-known paradoxes of different types.
