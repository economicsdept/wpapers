Title: The Efficient and Fair Approval of “Multiple-Cost-Single-Benefit” Projects Under Unilateral Information
Abstract: This paper focuses on indivisible multiple-cost–single-benefit projects that
must be approved by the government. A simple mechanism is proposed that ensures
an efficient and fair implementation of such projects. The proposed mechanism is
appropriate for a unilateral information structure: the single beneficiary has complete
information on the cost and benefit of the project while the government official has no
such information and the cost bearers have information only on each other's costs.
