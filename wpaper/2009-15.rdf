Title: Après nous le Déluge: Fertility and the Intensity of Struggle
against Immigration
Abstract: This paper is inspired by a puzzling empirical fact that despite the importance
of controlling migration for their future, the host countries allocate very
limited amounts of resources to the struggle against illegal immigration. The
present model analyzes this issue in the context of low fertility in the host
countries and suggests a novel channel though which the intensity of the
struggle against immigration can be related to fertility. The analysis shows
that for childless individuals, who have no reason to care about the future, it is
optimal to contribute less to the costly immigration-prevention measures.
