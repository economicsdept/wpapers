Title: Holiday Price Rigidity and Cost of Price Adjustment
Abstract: The Thanksgiving-Christmas holiday period is a major sales period for US retailers. Due
to higher store traffic, tasks such as restocking shelves, handling customers’ questions
and inquiries, running cash registers, cleaning, and bagging, become more urgent during
holidays. As a result, the holiday-period opportunity cost of price adjustment may
increase dramatically for retail stores, which should lead to greater price rigidity during
holidays. We test this prediction using weekly retail scanner price data from a major
Midwestern supermarket chain. We find that indeed, prices are more rigid during holiday
periods than non-holiday periods. For example, the econometric model we estimate
suggests that the probability of a price change is lower during holiday periods, even after
accounting for cost changes. Moreover, we find that the probability of a price change
increases with the size of the cost change, during both, the holiday as well as non-holiday
periods. We argue that these findings are best explained by higher price adjustment costs
(menu cost) the retailers face during the holiday periods. Our data provides a natural
experiment for studying variation in price rigidity because most aspects of market
environment such as market structure, industry concentration, the nature of long-term
relationships, contractual arrangements, etc., do not vary between holiday and nonholiday
periods. We, therefore, are able to rule out these commonly used alternative
explanations for the price rigidity, and conclude that the menu cost theory offers the best
explanation for the holiday period price rigidity.
