Title: Demystifying the 'Metric Approach to Social Compromise with the Unanimity Criterion'
Abstract: In a recent book and earlier studies, Donald Saari well clarifies the source of three
classical impossibility theorems in social choice and proposes possible escape out of
these negative results. The objective of this note is to illustrate the relevance of these
explanations in justifying the metric approach to the social compromise with the
unanimity criterion.
