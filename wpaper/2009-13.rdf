Title: A Reevaluation Of the Role Of Family In Immigrants' Labor Market
Activity;Evidence From a Comparison Of Single and Married Immigrants
Abstract: Previous papers tested the validity of the Family Investment Hypothesis (FIH) among immigrants
by comparing the labor market outcomes of immigrant couples and native or mixed couples. Here
we propose an alternative test for the FIH which is based on a comparison between married and
single immigrants. The logic underlying this alternative method states that if credit constraints are
binding, then only married immigrants can cross-finance their investment within the family. In
order to overcome potential selection bias that would arise if unobserved characteristics that affect
the marital status of the individual also affect his/her labor market outcomes, we construct a
difference-in-differences estimator that exploits variation in the labor market outcomes of married
and single natives. Implementation of this method using US and Israeli data leads to a rejection of
the FIH in both countries.
