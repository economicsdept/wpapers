Title: Sigma Convergence Versus Beta Convergence: Evidence from U.S. County-Level Data (revised version)
Abstract: In this paper we outline (i) why sigma-convergence may not accompany beta-convergence, (ii) discuss evidence of beta-convergence in the U.S., and (iii) use U.S. county-level data containing over 3,000 cross-sectional observations to demonstrate that sigma-convergence has not occurred at the county-level across the U.S., or within the vast majority of the individual U.S. states considered separately.
