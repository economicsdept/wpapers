Title: Wage Mobility in Israel: The Effect of Sectoral Concentration
Abstract: Using a unique eight-year data set, merging population census and national insurance
data, the paper examines and compares patterns of wage mobility in Israel. First, the
public and the private sectors are compared. Second, within each of these sectors, a
distinction is made between sub-sector groupings that exhibit a high level of
concentration and those that are more diffuse and unregulated. Based on alternative
measures of wage mobility, the central finding of the paper is that the extent of wage
mobility in a given economic sector is negatively related to the degree of concentration
in that sector.
