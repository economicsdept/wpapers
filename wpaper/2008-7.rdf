Title: Involuntary Integration in Public Education, Fertility and Human Capital
Abstract: This article analyzes the negative side of involuntary integration in public
education – its effect on whites. The model shows that the flight from the
integrated multicultural public schools to private education increases private
educational expenditures and decreases fertility among more affluent whites
whose children flee. In contrast, among less prosperous parents multicultural
integration in public education decreases their children’s human capital levels.
The analysis also demonstrates that among whites the poor, who can not afford
to avoid the forcible integration, suffer from a higher negative effect than the
rich, who can resort to the White Flight.
