Title: Federal, State, and Local Governments:Evaluating their Separate Roles in US Growth
Abstract: We use US county level data (3,058 observations) from 1970 to 1998 to
explore the relationship between economic growth and the extent of government
employment at three levels: federal, state and local. We find that increases in federal,
state and local government employments are all negatively associated with economic
growth. We find no evidence that government is more efficient at more decentralized
levels. While we cannot separate out the productive and redistributive services of
government, we document that the county-level income distribution became slightly
wider from 1970 to 1998. For those who justify government activities in terms of equity
concerns – perhaps even trading off economic growth for equity – the burden falls on
them to show that the income distribution would have widened more in the absence of
government activities. We conclude that a release of government-employed labor inputs
to the private sector would be growth-enhancing.
