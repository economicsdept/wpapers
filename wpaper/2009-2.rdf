Title: Group Specific Public Goods, Orchestration of Interest Groups
and Free Riding
Abstract: We consider a two group contest over a group specific public good where each
member of a group has a different benefit from the good. Our model can be
interpreted in two ways: Each of the players has a non-linear investment cost in the
contest, or alternatively, the returns to effort are decreasing as reflected in the contest
success function. In the first part of the paper we show conditions under which freeriding
decreases and consider the different properties of the equilibrium. In the second
part of the paper we develop the properties of the optimal formation of the group and
its affect on the equilibrium outcome.
