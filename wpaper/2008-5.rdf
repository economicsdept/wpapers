Title: Comparative Statics of Altruism and Spite
Abstract: The equilibrium outcome of a strategic interaction between two or more people may
depend on the weight they place on each other’s payoff. A positive, negative or zero weight
represents altruism, spite or complete selfishness, respectively. Paradoxically, the real,
material payoff in equilibrium for a group of altruists may be lower than for selfish or
spiteful groups. However, this can only be so if the equilibria involved are unstable. If they
are stable, the total (equivalently, average) payoff can only increase or remain unchanged
with an increasing degree of altruism.
