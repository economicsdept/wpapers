Title: Holiday Non-Price Rigidity and Cost of Adjustment
Abstract: There has been increasing interest in understanding how firms undertake non-price 
adjustment activities, especially in situations where prices may be rigid despite changes in market conditions. 
Using scanner price data for over 4,500 different food products from a large US supermarket chain, 
we document periods of rigidity in product additions and deletions: new products are less 
likely to be introduced, and existing products are less likely to be discontinued 
during holiday periods than throughout the rest of the year. We argue that this is 
due to higher costs of undertaking these kinds of product assortment activities during 
holiday periods. We discuss how this relates to the exiting literature on non-price adjustment
mechanisms, cost of price adjustment, and price rigidity.
