Title: Inter-Ethnic Redistribution and Human Capital Investments
Abstract: This article analyzes income redistribution in the inter-ethnic context. The model
shows that redistribution in favor of less prosperous ethnic minorities raises fertility
among the unskilled minority recipients, lowers fertility among the contributing local
skilled, slows human capital accumulation, and reduces the per-capita output growth.
The analysis also demonstrates that income redistribution, although financed by taxes
levied on the skilled, generates a mechanism that, via its disincentive effect on
human capital investment, works strongly against another weak segment of society –
the local unskilled. This may provide a purely economic explanation for antipathy
toward minorities, especially, among less educated.
