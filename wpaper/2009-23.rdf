Title:  The Big Carrot:High-Stakes Incentives Revisited
Abstract:  Using an international dataset of about 35,000 subjects, this paper
provides an empirical example of high-stakes incentives in relation to
religious practice. First, we show that incentives (based on absolute belief)
play a salient role in religious performance. Second, we find that, when
both positive (heaven) and negative (hell) incentives are available, the
former are more effective than the latter. Specifically, it is shown that
beliefs in heaven are much more relevant than beliefs in hell when
estimating the production of religious commodities (church-attendance
and praying equations).
