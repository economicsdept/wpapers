Title: National Aggregates and Individual Disaffiliation: An International Study
Abstract:  Using a data set of 15,000 subjects from 32 western countries, the current
study examines individuals who were raised in a certain religion and at some
stage of their lives left it. Currently, they define their religious affiliation as
‘no religion’. A battery of explanatory variables (country-specific, personal
attributes and marriage variables) was employed to test for determinants of
this decision. It was found that the tendency of individuals to leave their
religion is strongly correlated with the degree of religious diversity of their
country and with their spouse's religious characteristics. Moreover, personal
socio-demographic features seem to be less relevant.
