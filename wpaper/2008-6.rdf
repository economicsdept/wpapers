Title: Abortion and Human Capital Accumulation: A Contribution to the Understanding of the Gender
Gap in Education
Abstract: This article analyzes the relationship between abortion and female education. It
provides new empirical evidence from sub-Saharan Africa to show that more liberal
abortion policies are associated with a higher female secondary school enrollment.
It is assumed in the model that easier access to abortion decreases probability of
dropping out of school for a female child in the case of an occasional pregnancy. As
a consequence, it enhances parental investments in human capital of their female
offspring and helps to reduce the gender gap in education, as consistent with the
evidence.
