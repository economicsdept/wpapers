Title: A General Index of Inherent Risk
Abstract: We extend the pioneering work of Aumann and Serrano by presenting an index of inherent
riskiness of a gamble having the desirable properties of their index, while being applicable to gambles with
either positive or negative expectations. As such, our index provides a measure of riskiness which is of use
for both risk lovers and risk aversive gamblers, and is defined for all discrete and a large class of
continuous gambles. We analyze abstract properties of our index, and present in addition three empirical
applications - roulette, horse betting market and US options traded on financial stocks between 2005 and
2007.
